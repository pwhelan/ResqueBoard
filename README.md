ResqueBoard is an analytics software for PHP Resque. Monitor your workers health and job activities in realtime.

Unlike the [original resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque/#the-front-end), that display only what's happening right now, ResqueBoard remembers and saves  everything to compute metrics about your jobs and workers health in realtime.

Learn more on the [official website](http://resqueboard.kamisama.me), or take a look at the [demo](http://resque.kamisama.me/).

##Goals
ResqueBoard is built for 2 objectives :

* see what's happening right now in realtime
* visualize what's happened in the past with various charts, to easily benchmarks and balance your workers

##Minimum requirements

Although ResqueBoard is easy to install and run, you should not run it on a very basic webserver. It requires a minimum of processing power and memory for the various computation, and data storage.
